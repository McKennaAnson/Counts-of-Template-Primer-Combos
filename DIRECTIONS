Directions: 
1) Download the files titled Counts_Script.py, metadata.csv, maps.csv and run.csv.
2) Upload to your home directory.  
3) Create a text file with the names of the templates (delinated by a space) of your desired experiment from "Table 1: Experimental pools of primers and templates" in the study.
  * example file is provided in main
4) Repeate the step 3 process for the primers.
5) Run the code (make sure to change --exp, --t and --p to your desired experiment name and text file names).

Example:
I want to run the script to get counts for the "B27" experiment with the "template.txt" and "primer.txt" files:

  python3 Counts_Script --run run.csv --meta metadata.csv --exp B27 --map map.csv --t templates.txt --p primers.txt
